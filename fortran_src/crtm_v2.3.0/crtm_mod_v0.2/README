src_crtm:     Three CRTM source code files that are modified.
src_re:       Functions that calculate effective radius of hydrometer particles
              from air density, mixing ratio, and temperature.
coefficients: LUTs specifically generated for WSM6 microphysical scheme
              using scattering properties calculated from spherical particles
              using Mie scattering code. Little_endian

Note: for 183 GHz channels, need to use 16 streams.
