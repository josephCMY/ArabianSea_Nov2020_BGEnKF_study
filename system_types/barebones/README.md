# Documentation of Joseph's Bare-bones PSU-EnKF System (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
Author: Man-Yau ("Joseph") Chan

The PSU-EnKF system has loads of bells and whistles built in, many of which I do not use for my own research.

The hyperlinks listed on this README.md file serve as the documentation for my bare-bones system.

## Basic steps to use the PSU-EnKF system
In this series of notes, I will describe how to setup and run this bare-bones PSU-EnKF system. 
1) [Prepare the cluster's environment and compile relevant programs](documentation/basic_steps/part01_setting_up_and_compilation.md)
2) [Prepare the WRF ensemble for the PSU-EnKF](documentation/basic_steps/part02_prep_ensemble.md)
3) UNAVAILABLE: [Prepare observations for the PSU-EnKF](documentation/basic_steps/part03_prep_obs.md)
4) UNAVAILABLE: [Prepare an experiment directory on your cluster's SCRATCH space](documentation/basic_steps/part04_prep_expt_directory.md)
5) UNAVAILABLE: [Prepare an experiment's configuration file](documentation/basic_steps/part05_prep_config.md)
6) UNAVAILABLE: [How to run a PSU-EnKF experiment and how to check on it](documentation/basic_steps/part06_run_enkf.md)
